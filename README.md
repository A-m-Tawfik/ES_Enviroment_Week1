#  Week 1 Application Assignment 

 In this programming assignment you will create a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset. This assignment will help you get re-oriented with c-programming syntax and host machine compilation. We begin by setting up a version control repository on your local machine. You will then develop and test your code there. When complete, you will upload a zip of your repository to Coursera. Please read through all instructions before starting. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
